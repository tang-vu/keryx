**D-18** · Dashboard/Data · *Creator cash-outs (Gateway withdraws) live in their own `withdrawals` table, never in `payment_events`.* (user: surface real /tx/ proof on the dashboard)
A withdraw moves already-earned USDC OUT on-chain; it is not a new payment. Folding it into `payment_events` would double-count — `metrics()` aggregates that table for total payments, total volume, creator payouts, and reader→payer conversion, so every cash-out would inflate traction. A dedicated table keeps those figures honest while letting the dashboard surface the withdraw's real EVM mint hash — which, unlike the batched Circle settlement UUIDs in the payments feed, resolves at the explorer `/tx/` — as the hard per-tx on-chain proof that rewards are real, withdrawable USDC. Keyed by `tx_hash`, so re-recording the same withdraw is an idempotent no-op (the `withdraw` script persists on each live mint). Reversible: easy (drop the table + panel; no coupling to the payment path).

**D-17** · Trust · *Listing a source is permissionless, but EARNING requires feed-ownership proof.* (user: "do the best one")
Anyone can paste any RSS feed into the register form, so anyone could list a feed they don't own (Stripe's blog, Vitalik's site) with their own wallet and skim citation rewards — the content is real, but the wrong wallet gets paid. Fix: a `verified` flag gates the money path, not the directory. The agent (`run-agent.ts` discovery) only reads/cites/pays sources where `verified !== false`; unverified ones still appear in the registry, just off the rail. Proof = the owner places `keryx-verify:<payoutWallet>` anywhere in the feed (only whoever controls the feed's publishing pipeline can, and the token binds to the wallet so it can't be replayed) then POSTs `/api/sources/verify`. Migration-safe: the column defaults true, grandfathering the 17 curated seed rows + live VPS traction so the volume engine never stalls; only public web submissions start unverified. On-chain `register()` is the same squatting vector, so the indexer writes new rows unverified too (never downgrades an already-verified row). Reversible: easy (flip the discovery filter off). Note: `id = keccak256(creator, urlHash)` namespaces sources per wallet, so a verified owner can list their feed alongside any impostor copy and be the only one that earns.

**D-12** · Settlement · *Reuse x402 plumbing for BOTH toll moments instead of a new transfer primitive.*
Each source has its own wallet as `payTo`. (a) Fetch toll: agent `gateway.pay(/api/source/[id])` → real x402 settle to creator. (b) Citation reward: agent `gateway.pay(/api/cite/[id])` with dynamic price = weighted reward → real x402 settle to creator. Both land in `payment_events`. Why: every payment is a genuine batched on-chain settlement (no mocks), reusing verified code; no bespoke transfer path. Reversible: medium.

**D-11** · Settlement · *Two-tier economics: small fetch toll + weighted citation pool.*
Per query budget B. Fetch tolls are small per-source access fees (only on BUY). A citation pool (portion of B) is distributed AFTER synthesis by LLM-assigned contribution weight to sources actually cited. Sources fetched-but-not-cited keep only their toll; cited sources earn toll + weighted reward. Why: makes "paid per citation, weighted by contribution" literal and demoable; creates emergent budget behavior. Reversible: easy (tune pool %).

**D-10** · Multi-author · *Default to programmatic per-author nanopayments; on-chain splitter contract is an optional enhancement.*
When a source has N authors with split weights, send N weighted nanopayments to N wallets. Why: showcases nanopayment sub-cent floor, no contract deploy risk, fully real. On-chain `PaymentSplitter` (Circle Contracts) offered as enhancement for atomic splits. Reversible: easy.

**D-09** · Agent · *LLM-provider-agnostic `lib/llm` with Anthropic Claude default + deterministic heuristic fallback.*
Why: build/run/test the whole flow offline today (no key blocker); flip to real Claude reasoning for the demo. Claude (not OpenAI) since user is in the Anthropic ecosystem and we want best reasoning for the 30% sophistication score. Reversible: easy (swap provider).

**D-08** · Data · *Swappable `lib/db`: SQLite (better-sqlite3) for local dev, hosted Supabase for deploy.*
Why: no Docker locally → can't run Supabase locally; need to develop unblocked AND have a hosted DB for the Vercel demo. Single `db` interface keeps call sites clean. Reversible: medium.

**D-07** · Dashboard · *Poll every 1–2s instead of Supabase realtime subscriptions.*
Why: adapter-agnostic (works with SQLite + Supabase), simpler than scaffold's realtime, same screenshot-ready live effect. Reversible: easy (add realtime later for Supabase).

**D-06** · Traction · *Wire `arc-canteen push` for traction events + `circle feedback submit` for the dev-feedback prize.*
Why: `arc-canteen` is the literal mechanism the hackathon uses to track the 30% Traction score; feedback CLI captures the free $500 dev-feedback prize. Reversible: easy.

**D-05** · Discovery · *Internal source registry is the primary discovery channel; `circle services search` is a bonus external channel.*
Why: we control owned/registered creator sources (real payouts to real creators = traction); external x402 discovery is a nice-to-have. Reversible: easy.

**D-04** · Ingest · *Onboard sources via RSS (RSSHub or direct feed parse).*
Why: trivial one-click creator onboarding ("paste your RSS") → fast traction; RSSHub turns almost any site into a feed. Reversible: easy.

**D-03** · Product · *Name = Keryx; brand = "creators get paid every time an AI cites them."*
Why: repo is `keryx` (Greek herald/town-crier — announces + is paid); fits the per-citation narrative. Reversible: hard (naming).

**D-02** · Scope · *Keep the scaffold's working x402/Gateway plumbing verbatim; rebuild only the agent + creator economy on top.*
Why: payments are the risky/verified part — don't re-derive them; spend effort on the reasoning brain (the differentiator). Reversible: n/a.

**D-01** · Chain · *Build on Arc testnet (5042002) with a single mainnet config flag.*
Why: hackathon guardrail — no real money without go-ahead. Reversible: easy (config).

**D-15** · Enhancements · *Implement all four enhancements, sequenced by score-impact.* (user: "all four; you decide how to win")
Order: (1) Agent-to-agent mode — expose Keryx as a paid x402 endpoint other agents call; (2) External x402 discovery via `circle services search`; (3) Onchain PaymentSplitter (Circle Contracts) for atomic splits; (4) ERC-8004 agent identity + creator reputation feeding source selection. Core (web app + real settlement + volume) lands first. Reversible: easy (each is additive).

**D-14** · LLM · *Add DeepSeek (OpenAI-compatible) as the default cheap provider; Anthropic still supported.* (user choice — cheaper)
Shared `JsonChatEngine` base holds all prompts once; `AnthropicEngine` + `OpenAICompatibleEngine` are thin transports. Provider priority: Anthropic > DeepSeek > heuristic. Reversible: easy.

**D-13** · Deploy · *Primary deploy = run locally + Cloudflare Tunnel (cloudflared) for the public URL; keep SQLite.* (user suggestion — good fit)
Drops the Supabase + Vercel hard-dependency: the app + funded wallet + volume engine run on the local machine, exposed publicly via tunnel. Trade-off: live only while the machine/tunnel run (fine for demo + volume window). Supabase/Vercel path stays available behind config for always-on hosting. Reversible: easy (config flag).

**D-12b** · Recording · *The agent (client) is the single recorder of payments in both modes; x402 server endpoints settle but don't double-write.*
The agent has full context (queryId, rationale, weight, contribution) and runs the same recording offline & online with the real tx hash from `gateway.pay`. A2A external payers get server-side recording in that endpoint variant. Reversible: medium.

**D-16** · Discovery · *External x402 marketplace = discovery + reasoning only; never purchased (off-Arc rail enforced in code).* (user choice — "discover + decide, don't buy")
Each query the agent probes the live Circle x402 bazaar (`circle services search`, one cached snapshot), ranks endpoints locally by topical relevance, and the engine reasons BUY/SKIP over them alongside registered creators. The orchestrator then forces every external endpoint to SKIP — they settle on other chains (Base/ETH/… mainnet, none on Arc), so they're evaluated and logged but not settled (mirrors the budget-cap enforcement). Honors the no-real-money rule while adding Circle `services` tooling + open-economy agency with zero cross-chain spend. Reversible: easy (a Base-Sepolia testnet pay path can be added behind a flag later).

## Open questions (for the human) — RESOLVED
- LLM key: ✅ Anthropic primary + DeepSeek fallback (D-09, D-14).
- DB: ✅ local SQLite on the VPS is the source of truth; Supabase adapter kept behind config (D-08, D-13).
- Funder wallet: ✅ funded; real settlement is live (`KERYX_FORCE_OFFLINE=0`), 500+ settled payments.
- Deploy target: ✅ VPS at keryx.cc via Cloudflare Tunnel, not Vercel (D-13).
